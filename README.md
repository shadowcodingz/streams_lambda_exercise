# 🚀 Project Template: Standardized Development & Collaboration

Welcome to the **Lxisoft Standard Project Template**!

This template repository is designed to ensure consistency, high traceability, and maintainability across all our software development projects. By using this template, you automatically inherit:

1. Standardized **Epic, Feature, Story, and Task** issue templates.
2. Mandatory **Conventional Commit** messages with issue ID linking.
3. Automated **Semantic Versioning** and **Changelog** generation.

## 🛠️ Developer Setup: Standardization Guide

This template uses **Husky** and **Commitlint** to automatically enforce commit message standards locally, and **Standard-Version** to manage releases.

### 1. Initialize Project Standards (Mandatory)

After cloning your new repository from this template, run the following commands **one time** to install dependencies and activate the Git hooks:


### 1. Install project dependencies (this includes husky, commitlint, and standard-version)

```npm install                                                ```

### 2. The 'prepare' script in package.json automatically runs 'husky install'
 This activates the 'commit-msg' hook on your local machine, enforcing commit rules.

#### 📝 Commit Message Standards & Commitizen

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format and reference an issue ID in the body.

**Standard commit types (`type-enum`):**
- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- perf
- test
- build
- ci
- chore
- revert

**Recommended scopes (`scope-enum`):**
- api, app, auth, build, ci, config, core, docs, deps, devops, feature, infra, model, service, test, ui, util, web, mobile
- Flutter: widget, screen, bloc, provider, theme, assets
- Java: controller, repository, entity, service, dto, spring, jpa
- TS/JS: component, hook, store, redux, context, types, eslint, webpack

**How to create a commit:**
- Use Commitizen for interactive commit messages:

```npx cz                                            ```

#### 🚀 Release Process (Semantic Versioning & Changelog)

This project uses [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for automated releases:

1. **Commit your changes** using conventional commit messages.
2. **Run the release command:**
3. ``` npx standard-version                          ```


3. **What happens:**
- The version in `package.json` is bumped (major, minor, or patch).
- A `CHANGELOG.md` is generated or updated.
- A new git commit and tag are created for the release.
4. **Push your changes and tags:**


``` git push --follow-tags                          ```


This automates semantic versioning and changelog management for your project.

### 🔀 Branching & Release Workflow

This repository uses two main branches:

- `main`: Stable production-ready code. Releases are tagged from here.
- `developer`: Active development. All new features, fixes, and changes are merged here first.

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Work on feature or fix branches, then merge into `developer`.
2. Regularly merge `developer` into `main` after review and testing.
3. Run the release process from the `main` branch:
	 - Ensure all changes from `developer` are merged into `main`.
	 - Run:
		 ```
		 npx standard-version
		 git push --follow-tags
		 ```
	 - This will bump the version, update the changelog, and tag the release.
4. Optionally, create release branches (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`) for hotfixes or pre-release testing.

**Summary:**
- All development happens in `developer`.
- Only stable, reviewed code is merged to `main` and released.
- Releases are always tagged from `main`.

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Work on feature or fix branches, then merge into `developer`.
	 - Create a new branch for your work:
		 ```
		 git checkout developer
		 git pull
		 git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
		 ```
	 - After committing your changes, push and create a pull request to `developer`:
		 ```
		 git push origin feature/my-new-feature
		 ```
2. Regularly merge `developer` into `main` after review and testing:
	 - Merge changes from `developer` to `main`:
		 ```
		 git checkout main
		 git pull
		 git merge developer
		 git push origin main
		 ```
3. Run the release process from the `main` branch:
	 - Ensure all changes from `developer` are merged into `main`.
	 - Run:
		 ```
		 npx standard-version
		 git push --follow-tags
		 ```
	 - This will bump the version, update the changelog, and tag the release.
4. Optionally, create release branches (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`) for hotfixes or pre-release testing:
	 ```
	 git checkout main
	 git pull
	 git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
	 git push origin release/v1.0.0
	 ```
